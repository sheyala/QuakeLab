README - inversion and modelling tools for Shakelab

"fas_modelling" branch - New batch of changes in order to integrate 
it with ShakeLab (04/08/23)

This is the attempt to build a version of the spectral inversion software 
to be compatible with the Shakelab package.

An actual minimal usage manual is under implementation and will be uploaded ASAP.

All licenses are the same as for the Shakelab project.
All codes were written by Laura Cataldi.
