README - modelling and inversion tools
---------------------------------------

This is the core of the package:

- create_synth_pars = create one or more synthetic parameter sets in the
                      form of Params() objects and save them as pickle files

- fas_log = tools for calculating the forwards FAS model and the corresponding
            cost function, given a dataset for comparison

- inversion = tools to perform parametric spectral inversion on the chosen
              signal component

- jacobian_module = calculate the explicit jacobian associated to the chosen
                    forward model, to be used for inversion calculations

- wrap_function = utilities for calling to the scipy.optimize.minimize tool


The sample databases are provided as .pkl files, both for the signal and noise 
components. The path for database to be used can be modified inside the
"config" module (config.REFS['REFERENCE_DB']).
