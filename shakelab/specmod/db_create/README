main function: create_spectralpkl()

This folder contains the parser used to create the input pickle databases, 
starting from pickles containing a StreamCollection object with all of the 
available Streams relative to each event.

It does NOT cover the creation of the pickle files.

It allows to set different specifications for the MODELS choices (which source
model to be used - TO BE IMPLEMENTED; which motion component to model (a/v/d);
which frequency point to use in the calulations) and to specify custom
reference paths (home folder, location of input pickle files, location of 
parameter files, name of the database to be used...).
